# üìä sales_and_customer_reporting_Analysis

This repository contains a series of optimized and structured SQL scripts aimed at analyzing business performance across multiple dimensions including customer behavior, product performance, sales trends, and more.

Each SQL script serves a specific analytical purpose and leverages advanced SQL functions like window functions, CTEs, and conditional logic to derive meaningful insights from raw transactional data.
